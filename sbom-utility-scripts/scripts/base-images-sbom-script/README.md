# base images sbom script

This is a script that creates sbom data for base images. It is used in 
[buildah task](https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions/tree/main/task/buildah) in Konflux pipelines.

It takes several inputs:
1. path to the sbom file, that will be updated in place with the base image data
2. path to a file containing base images as taken from from the dockerfile (with preserved order)
3. path to a file containing base images with digests, generated from the output of **buildah images --format '{{ .Name }}:{{ .Tag }}@{{ .Digest }}'**. The dockerfile order must be preserved as well



The base images data will be added in the [formulation attribute](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.5/json/#formulation), by appending new item with the **components** array.
This will not affect any other items in the formulation array. If the formulation part of the sbom does not exist, it is created.
The result might look like this:

```
    ...
    "formulation": [
        {
            "components": [
                {
                    "type": "container",
                    "name": "quay.io/mkosiarc_rhtap/single-container-app",
                    "purl": "pkg:oci/single-container-app@sha256:8f99627e843e931846855c5d899901bf093f5093e613a92745696a26b5420941?repository_url=quay.io/mkosiarc_rhtap/single-container-app",
                    "properties": [
                        {
                            "name": "konflux:container:is_builder_image:for_stage",
                            "value": "0",
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "type": "container",
                    "name": "registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi",
                    "purl": "pkg:oci/ubi@sha256:627867e53ad6846afba2dfbf5cef1d54c868a9025633ef0afd546278d4654eac?repository_url=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi",
                    "properties": [
                        {
                            "name": "konflux:container:is_builder_image:for_stage",
                            "value": "1",
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
    ...
```

If a base image is used multiple times, only one component with multiple properties will be created e.g.:
```
{
                    "type": "container",
                    "name": "quay.io/builder1/builder1",
                    "purl": "pkg:oci/builder1@sha256:1f99627e843e931846855c5d899901bf093f5093e613a92745696a26b5420941"?repository_url=quay.io/builder1/builder1",
                    "properties": [
                        {
                            "name": "konflux:container:is_builder_image:for_stage",
                            "value": "0",
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "konflux:container:is_builder_image:for_stage",
                            "value": "2",
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "konflux:container:is_builder_image:for_stage",
                            "value": "4",
                        },
                    ],
                },
```


## The image
The image that is used in the buildah task in Konflux is built by the Github CI and pushed to
**quay.io/redhat-appstudio/base-images-sbom-script** tagged with the commit sha.

## Tests
The unit tests are triggered on each pull requests in Github CI via tox. You can run them locally
during development with:

```
tox -e test
```
